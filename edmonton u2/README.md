# Edmonton Transit Siemens–Düwag U2

- Manufacturer: Siemens
- Technical Details

The U2's dimensions are $24.284 \text{m}$ (79 ft 8.1 in) by 2.650 m (8 ft 8.3 in) by 3.66 m (12 ft 0 in). The articulated halves of each car can be seen as a married pair; in the US, usually up to three such 'pairs' run together. Each articulated car has a total passenger capacity of 264 passengers. It may be equipped with two DC motors for a total power output of 300 kW (400 hp) and a maximum speed of 80 km/h (50 mph), or with four AC motors for an output of 544 kW (730 hp) and speed of 88 km/h (55 mph).

As the length of a tram or light-rail train running on shared track is restricted to a maximum of 75 meters in Germany, up to three U2 cars may be used in a single consist on such track.

Frankfurt U2 cars use a Scheren (diamond) pantograph, while Calgary, Edmonton and San Diego vehicles use a single-arm (z-shaped) pantograph.
