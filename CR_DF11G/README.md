# Chinese Railway Dongfeng-11G MOD

BlueMap is a tool that generates 3d-maps of your Minecraft worlds and displays them in your browser. Take a look at this demo. It is really easy to set up - almost plug-and-play - if you use the integrated web-server (optional).

The plugins/mods automatically update your map as soon as something changes in your world, as well as rendering newly generated terrain and managing the render-tasks.

Some features and some blocks are still missing. Especially some tile-entities will not render correctly/at all. See below for a list of what is planned for future releases.

Using BlueMap
BlueMap can be used on the command-line, or as a plugin/mod for your Sponge/Spigot/Paper/Forge/Fabric-Server. Read the wiki to get started!

Clone
If you have git installed, simply use the command git clone --recursive https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/BlueMap.git to clone BlueMap.

Build
In order to build BlueMap you simply need to run the ./gradlew clean build command in BlueMap's root directory. You can find the compiled JAR files in ./build/release.

Issues / Suggestions
You found a bug, have another issue or a suggestion? Please create an issue here!

Contributing
You are welcome to contribute! Just create a pull request with your changes :)

If you want to have your changes merged, make sure they are complete, documented and well tested!

Keep in mind that we have to maintain all new features and keep supporting them in the future. This means we always can decide to not accept a PR for any reason.

Todo / planned features
Here is a todo-list! It is ordered by what i right now think is the priority, but it might always change or be reordered at my discretion. (I develop BlueMap in my free-time, so nothing here is a promise and there are no ETA's)
