## Why the U2's?

I like the U2's. They are the **GM Fishbowls** of the rails—of an extra simple, clean and classic timeless style.

- Manufacturer: Siemens
- Technical Details

The U2's dimensions are $24.284 \text{ m}$ (79 ft 8.1 in) by 2.650 m (8 ft 8.3 in) by 3.66 m (12 ft 0 in). The articulated halves of each car can be seen as a married pair; in the US, usually up to three such 'pairs' run together. Each articulated car has a total passenger capacity of 264 passengers. It may be equipped with two DC motors for a total power output of 300 kW (400 hp) and a maximum speed of 80 km/h (50 mph), or with four AC motors for an output of 544 kW (730 hp) and speed of 88 km/h (55 mph).

As the length of a tram or light-rail train running on shared track is restricted to a maximum of 75 meters in Germany, up to three U2 cars may be used in a single consist on such track.

Frankfurt U2 cars use a Scheren (diamond) pantograph, while Calgary, Edmonton and San Diego vehicles use a single-arm (z-shaped) pantograph.

Katstel:
Updated the soundtrack for U2 (largely blending with and adapted from the sound mod for Frankfurt U-Bahn transit system)

The U2 light rail car is an electric multiple unit consisted of two carriages, both with powersupply via overhead wire and one with a pantograph (carriage A), developed in the late 1960s. They were the first trainset for the light rail of Frankfurt/Germany (inaugurated in 1968) and were derived from their two prototype trains called U1. The LRV series names ranging from U1 to U5 in Frankfurt are not to be confused with the light rail lines U1 to U9 where they are in use.
